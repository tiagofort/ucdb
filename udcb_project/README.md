# 🧠 KNOWLEDGE AND ATTITUDES OF MEDICAL STUDENTS REGARDING SUICIDE – React + JavaScript + CSS

This project is a simple, lightweight survey application built using **React**, **vanilla CSS**, and **JavaScript**. 
**About:** 
This project was requested by the Psychology Team for studies related to suicide. This study aims to explore how medical students perceive the topic of suicide, identifying their level of understanding and personal attitudes toward this sensitive issue. The outcomes of this study may contribute to the development of future interventions aimed at healthcare professionals—especially medical students and practicing physicians—by informing strategies related to suicide awareness and prevention.

## 📌 Why React + JavaScript + Pure CSS?

The choice of **React** and **vanilla CSS** was driven by the need for simplicity and reusability without the overhead of complex frameworks or styling libraries. As the project was designed to be **self-contained and not scalable in the long term**, using:
- **React** allowed for clear component separation and state management,
- **JavaScript** enabled dynamic behavior with minimal complexity,
- **CSS** provided just enough styling without adding dependencies.

Reusable components were emphasized to **reduce repetition**, improve **maintainability**, and **separate concerns** cleanly between logic and presentation.

## 🧱 Components

- **`ConfirmationModal.jsx`**  
  Displays a confirmation modal after each slider interaction on Form 2. The user must confirm the response to proceed.

- **`QuestionSlider.jsx`**  
  Used for range-type questions in Form 2. It includes a slider (`<input type="range">`) and custom behavior that restricts answering to one question at a time.

- **`RadioGroup.jsx`**  
  Used for rendering groups of radio buttons in Form 1 (e.g., gender, education, etc.).

- **`SelectInput.jsx`**  
  A reusable select component used in Form 1, populated dynamically from JSON data.

---

## 🗃️ Data

Static files serve as a lightweight data source:

- **`cidades.json`**  
  Contains a list of cities, dynamically populated in the city select based on the selected state.

- **`estados.js`**  
  Provides the list of Brazilian states for the Form 1 select input.

- **`form2.js`**  
  Contains the text labels for each question in Form 2.

## 🎨 CSS

All pages have separate CSS files:
- `form1.css`, `form2.css`, `form2Instruction.css`, `index.css`

This modular CSS approach avoids style leakage and keeps concerns isolated per page.

## 📄 Pages

### ✅ `index.jsx`
The entry point of the application. Presents the research description, the team behind it, and the **consent form**. The user must agree to continue.

### ✅ `Form1.jsx`
The first formal page of the questionnaire. Collects basic sociodemographic information from the participant using radio buttons and select fields.

### ✅ `Form2Instruction.jsx`
An instructional page to prepare users for the main survey. It explains how the slider-based questions work.

### ✅ `Form2.jsx`
The **core of the research**. Participants answer one slider-based question at a time:
- Each question uses a range slider (0–100).
- Only one question is enabled at a time.
- The current question is **highlighted in yellow**, while others appear white.
- After moving the slider, a **confirmation modal** is triggered.
  - If the user clicks **Yes**, the form advances to the next question.
  - If **No**, the same question remains active.

This step-by-step structure ensures careful responses and clear user flow.
